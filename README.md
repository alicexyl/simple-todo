# Simple To Do App

I started this project using [Marionette's Webpack skeleton](https://github.com/marionettejs/marionette-integrations/tree/master/webpack).

Currently it can fetch todo list data from the server and display in a list. Upcoming: interactive functions and styling.

## Accessing the app

1. Inside this folder run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run build` to build the project 
2. Open `public/index.html` to see the app
