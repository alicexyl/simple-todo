# Simple To Do App

I started this project using [Marionette's Webpack skeleton](https://github.com/marionettejs/marionette-integrations/tree/master/webpack).

All development assets are in `app/` directory:

- `components/`: JS sources
- `sass/` contains styling sources
- `templates/`: templates used by views

`build` command generates `public/` directory.

## Accessing the app

1. Inside this folder run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run build` to build the project 
2. Open `public/index.html`
